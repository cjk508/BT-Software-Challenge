BT-Software-Challenge
=====================

Software Challenge for BT Assessment Centre

To execute this program type (for Unix)

```
python "employmentTree.py" *input text file* *First Employee Name* *Second Employee Name*
```

The text in astericks is required, however you will be prompted for them if you forget.

I have assumed that removed entries are entirely blank rows, if rows do have splits then false keys in the lookups are removed and badly formatted lines are skipped
